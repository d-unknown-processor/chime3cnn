run_cnn_chime3.sh is a Kaldi recipe script for training and decoding using a CNN-DNN + sMBR based decoder for evaluation of 
the CHiME-3 challenge dataset.
%%%%%%%
The CNN-DNN implementation is based on 
T.N. Sainath, A.-R. Mohamed, B. Kingsbury, and  B. Ramabhadran, “Deep convolutional neural networks for LVCSR,” 
in Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2013 IEEE International Conference on, May 2013, pp. 8614–8618.

USAGE:
For using this script, copy the script to /<localpath>/CHiME3/tools/ASR/ 
Execute the run.sh script already in the CHiME-3 folder for the necessary alignment files.
If run.sh is already executed for the custom $enhancement_method, run the provided script as

run_cnn_chime3.sh $enhancement_method
