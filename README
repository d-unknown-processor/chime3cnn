USAGE:
For using this script, copy the script to /<localpath>/CHiME3/tools/ASR/ 
Execute the run.sh script already in the CHiME-3 folder for the necessary alignment files.
If run.sh is already executed for the custom $enhancement_method, run the provided script as

run_cnn_chime3.sh $enhancement_method
